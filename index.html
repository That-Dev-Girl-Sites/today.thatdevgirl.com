    Hey there fellow web geeks!

    Is it just me, or does it feel like time froze in March 2020? And, that
    March 2020 was about 400 years ago. (I don't think it's just me.)

    If you are like me and are wondering what date it is, here you go!
    (Disclaimer: If you actually need to figure out the real date in reality,
    please do not use this site. Ask Siri/Alexa/Google/<insert your favorite AI>
    instead.)

    This has likely been created a million times over, but I like sarcasm, so
    here is one more. Enjoy!

    If you want to see more of what I do (warning: it is not sarcastic), check
    out my portfolio website at https://thatdevgirl.com.

    If you want to see a mix of serious dev thoughts, sarcasm, random antics
    by my 2-year-old, exasperated sighs about the current state of the US, and,
    frankly, whatever else I feel like posting, follow me on Twitter at @jonihalabi.
